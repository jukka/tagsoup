Notice: It's quite possible that none of these features will ever be
implemented.  If you'd like to implement one yourself, feel free to send
me a patch.

Flag added parent elements with a special attribute
Allow case sensitivity as a standard feature
Don't see </script> tag when in pseudo-comment in script element
Don't just chuck out namespace declarations
Allow inline cruft in table bodies and rows
	(Don't break up tables, ever?)
	(Don't break up forms, ever, either?)
Suppress start-tags for restartable elements if the element
	is already on the stack (<b><b> is the same as <b>)
Combine consecutive body elements
